# Flakiness

As a tool for end-to-end testing, Playwright provides the means to eliminate flakiness from your test scripts.

## Causes of flakiness

In my experience what makes tests flaky is not having enough knowledge about the state of your app under test and what reliably signifies a "ready" state.

## Why is Playwright different

Playwright is a bi-directional automation driver.

## How can you use it

### Auto waits

### Explicitly waiting

### Listen for events

## Other scenarios
